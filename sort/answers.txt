sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:
On a large random list it had the longest runtime,
but on a sorted list was much faster.
So the upper bound was much higher than the lower bound.


sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:
This method had a similar runtime no matter if the data
was random, sorted, or reversed. It was MUCH faster than
the other two.


sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:
On a random list this was faster than sort1(bubble), but much slower
than sort2(merge). On a sorted listed it did not improve. The
upper and lower bounds are the same.
